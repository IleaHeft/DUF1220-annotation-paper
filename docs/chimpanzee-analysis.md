# How to run the analysis for Chimpanzee

1. Modify the scripts/config.sh file to reflect the parameters for chimpanzee rather than human
2. Run ```bash scripts/workflow-1.sh```
3. Run ```bash scripts/workflow-2.sh```
4. Run ```bash scripts/get-fasta-chimpanzee-long-exons.sh```
2. At present, the exon annotations for chimpanzee are poor and most short exons are not annotated.
